        <h1>The HTML Saga - Learning how to code in HTML</h1>
        <h2>My First Day With HTML</h2>

        Hey there! Welcome to my <b>very first website!</b> To go to the next day, click <a href="daytwo.html">here</a> <b>CHANGE THIS LATER ONCE YOUVE GOT ALL THE CONNECTING PAGES FIGURED</b>
        <hr>
        This is also the first page I am writing, and where I'll track all of my progress in learning how to write an HTML site!

        <p>
            Day 1: May 23, 2025
            In about an hour before I had to leave for work i downloaded vscode, and created the local html file. I've learned a couple simple tags, but cant get them to carry over correctly to the front end of the site. 

            I did already do some searching within vscode and found that the language type was set to plain text instead of HTML, hopefully later tonight I'll get some bolded text in this paragraph!

            Apoligies in advance for anyone who has to read this in the future, as I'm planning to keep each day (or group of days) page at the complexity of the code I could write at the time, hopefully for someone reading through all of this at once, it'll be a nice visual journey to see my progress!

        </p>

        <h3>One Shift Later...</h3>

        <p> I'm back! and I got all of the tags to work! my problem wasnt even in vscode, but the the file i was using wasnt an html doc to the comuputer, just a text file. <br>
            Also, I got different font sizes now, along with paragraphs, breaks, and horizontal rules <br>
            <b>I can add images!! Here's a cute cat from the cat wiki!</b> <br>
            (also with a border around it cause I did also learn how to resize and border images)
        </p>

        <p>
            To help me get ordered and unorderd lists figured out, I'm gonna write down all the things I now know how to do in HTML, and then maybe a top three for an ordered list.

        This was a pretty good first day. Hopefully tomorrow I can see how expensive it would be to get the site to go live on the actual internet! <br>
